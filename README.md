# 🛡️ SOC Analyst Portfolio & Blue Team Handbook

Welcome to my **SOC Analyst Portfolio** – a curated collection of everything I learn, practice, and build as I develop my skills in **Blue Teaming, Threat Detection, Digital Forensics, and Incident Response**.

This repository is designed to serve three main purposes:

1️⃣ **My Personal SOC Handbook**  
A structured knowledge base I can always refer back to  
(especially during internships, real-world work, and interviews).

2️⃣ **Detection & Investigation Playbook**  
Practical notes on:
- how attacks work  
- what logs to analyze  
- how to detect them  
- how to respond to incidents  

3️⃣ **Portfolio Proof of Work**  
Documenting hands-on labs, case studies, malware analysis, DFIR scenarios, and SOC challenges to demonstrate real blue-team capability.

## 👤 About Me

I am a cybersecurity enthusiast focused on **Blue Team / SOC Operations**.  
My interests include:

- Security Operations & Monitoring  
- Threat Detection & Hunting  
- Digital Forensics & Incident Response  
- Malware Analysis & Reverse Engineering  
- Cloud Security & SIEM  

My goal is to build strong fundamentals and practical investigation skills to become a **skilled SOC Analyst / Blue Team Engineer**.

## 🎯 Why I Built This Repository

Just learning concepts wasn’t enough.

Over time I realized:
- concepts fade if not documented
- logs and detection reasoning are easy to forget
- a SOC Analyst must think fast, recall patterns, and recognize attacks quickly

So instead of only watching content, I decided to:
✔ study  
✔ break down the concept  
✔ document it like a professional detection guide  
✔ practice labs  
✔ store **everything in one place**

This repo is my **living handbook** — something I can use anytime in the future.

## 🏫 Learning Source – LetsDefend

A major part of this journey is powered by the **LetsDefend SOC Analyst Learning Path**, where I am learning:

- Real SOC workflows
- Incident handling
- SIEM investigations
- Threat intelligence usage
- Malware & DFIR fundamentals

Instead of just completing labs and moving on, I am deeply analyzing each topic and challenge, and documenting:

- What the attack is
- Why it happens
- How attackers exploit it
- What logs look like
- How to detect it
- How defenders should respond

This makes the learning meaningful, repeatable, and referenceable.
